<HTML><BODY>A study into the nature of Christianity (and religion in general) by the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, a student of Hegel. This book provides a critique of Christianity which strongly influenced generations of later thinkers, including Karl Marx and Frederich Engels.

<p>The German original dates from 1841; this is the English translation of the second edition, 1855, reprinted in 1890.

<p>The first pages with advertisements are somewhat hard to read, due to the small print, and have OCR-ed badly; the remainder should be fairly straightforward. Some Latin required, but not enough to mark it as "with Latin".
